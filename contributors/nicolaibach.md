## Programming/Development Experience

Nicolai is (more or less) experienced in working with these languages:

- Node.js
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP

He can work on the frontend and the backend and also loves a good documentation. But his favorite environment might be CLI applications.

## Pet Project(s)

Most of his favorite projects are not public or not online anymore.

He once [found a bug in the Firefox CSS engine](https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset/issues/11) which lead to a [fix in *The New CSS Reset*](https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset/issues/11). That was a fun one.
